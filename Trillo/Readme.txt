You dont need to download or clone whole node-modules folder.
You just need package.json file which has already defined all node modules and dependencies needed and used in project.
So, just go to command promt,go inside the project directory/folder,and type===>   npm install
This will install all node modules and dependencies by creating a new node-modules folder inside your project.
