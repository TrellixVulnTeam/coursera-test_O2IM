Because of its similarity to SARS-CoV, the virus has been named: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes the disease referred to as COVID-19 - Coronavirus disease 2019. 		Similar to other coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to have come from animals, potentially bats.
